## Social Impact Exhibit - 14 Faculties

The goal of this project is to create a museum-like experience through an exhibit in U.Porto's rectory, which aims to present each one of the 14 faculties of the University.
A visitor to U.Porto's rectory can get to know each faculty, its projects and resulting impact in society, as well as future prospects on tomorrow's world by interacting with a tablet. Each faculty has its own user experience and visual aspect.

Although there are somewhat similar apps (_e.g._ [Study UK Exhibitions](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.education.education_exhibitions&_ga=2.81994832.730515720.1538341544-1603621910.1538341544)), where you can get to know a faculty and events it organises, these apps are not tailored for the social impact the faculties' projects have, and cannot be configured to our client's use case.
