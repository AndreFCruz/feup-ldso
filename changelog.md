# Sprint 1
In this first sprint, the goal was to get all the necessary tools to start working ready and to start working on the mobile app, most specifically on a base structure for all the pages, with information dynamically retrieved from a fake API (as working on the back end was not planned) with proper navigation between them. Despite a more than desired delay on the initial setup, the conceived increment was done: the mobile app has a base structure for all screens and is navigable.
In more technical terms, the start of a CI system was achieved, as well as containerization of the development environment.

****Velocity evaluation:**** The initial delay caused two of the sprint goal PBIs (
[#1](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g1/issues/1) and 
[#8](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g1/issues/8)) to not be completed, although they were being worked on. Since the initial delay, caused by a lack of knowledge about some of the tools used, is not to be expected again, the group considers the estimated velocity to not have been (grossly) off.

# Sprint 2
In the second sprint, the goal was to have a functional back end server so as to be able to ditch the fake API, develop some editing functionalities in the web app and start to refine the mobile app's design (converging to a final solution, despite some constant mockup refinement). However, this was all preceded by an overall information restructure (mainly on the mobile app) to facilitate development (e.g. Redux integration) and impose some development guidelines. This caused some delay in the actual redesign of the mobile app screens.
In more technical terms, the sever was successfully containerized, a unit test structure for the mobile app was created and a linter has been attached.

****Velocity evaluation:**** The necessary information restructure on the mobile app delayed the redesign of the screens, which caused some issues to not be completed, namely [#47](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g1/issues/47) (mid way completed), [#8](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g1/issues/8) and [#50](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g1/issues/50) (not started). For this reason, the group will lower the estimated velocity for the next sprint to around 21 points (+- 1/2 points).
