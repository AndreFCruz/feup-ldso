# Sprint 1
In this first sprint, the goal was to get all the necessary tools to start working ready and to start working on the mobile app, most specifically on a base structure for all the pages, with information dynamically retrieved from a fake API (as working on the back end was not planned) with proper navigation between them. Despite a more than desired delay on the initial setup, the conceived increment was done: the mobile app has a base structure for all screens and is navigable.
In more technical terms, the start of a CI system was achieved, as well as containerization of the development environment.

# Sprint 2
In the second sprint, the goal was to have a functional back end server so as to be able to ditch the fake API, develop some editing functionalities in the web app and start to refine the mobile app's design (converging to a final solution, despite some constant mockup refinement). However, this was all preceded by an overall information restructure (mainly on the mobile app) to facilitate development (e.g. Redux integration) and impose some development guidelines. This caused some delay in the actual redesign of the mobile app screens.
In more technical terms, the sever was successfully containerized, a unit test structure for the mobile app was created and a linter has been attached.

# Sprint 3
In the third sprint, the goal was to start converging to the expected final solution, while finishing up the setup for good development practices (development guideline enforcement). For this, much of the mobile app screens were redesigned to meet the final mockups' look. There was also the need to create new screens due to late, high priority information requirements. Web app wise, editing a social project functionality was introduced.
In more technical terms, linters were enforced in the web app and server, a unit test structure was developed for the remaining modules (i.e. server and web app), inclusive some tests added to them, and CD implemented for the server.
