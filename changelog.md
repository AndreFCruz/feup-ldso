# Sprint 1
In this first sprint, the goal was to get all the necessary tools to start working ready and to start working on the mobile app, most specifically on a base structure for all the pages, with information dynamically retrieved from a fake API (as working on the back end was not planned) with proper navigation between them. Despite a more than desired delay on the initial setup, the conceived increment was done: the mobile app has a base structure for all screens and is navigable.
In more technical terms, the start of a CI system was achieved, as well as virtualization of the development environment.

****Velocity evaluation:**** The initial delay caused two of the sprint goal PBIs (
[#1](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g1/issues/1) and 
[#8](https://gitlab.com/ldso18-19/t3g1/issues/8)) to not be completed, although they were being worked on. Since the initial delay, caused by a lack of knowledge about some of the tools used, is not to be expected again, the group considers the estimated velocity to not have been (grossly) off.
